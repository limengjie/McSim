       get_attr_value adds dieVec argument.
     * dieholder.h: Create new type DieVec for the die vector.
     * print_die.cc: Check DW_AT_sibling values for sanity,
       and when something quite wrong is found, print an error
       and stop. Uses DieVec now. Corrected some mistakes
       in handling the vector.
     * globals.h: Uses DieVec now, for print_one_die(),
       get_attr_value.
     * print_aranges.cc: Uses DieVec now.

     * checkutil.h: A 64bit constant was missing the trailing ULL
