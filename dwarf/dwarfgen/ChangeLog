       ireptodbg.cc,strtabdata.h: updated copyright year to 2013.
     * createirepformfrombinary.cc: Added missing implemenation
       detals for all FORMs and FormFlag.
     * createirepfrombinary.cc: Rename some local variables
       for readability
       based on the realization that dwarf_whatform and
       dwarf_whatform_direct() are misnamed.
     * irepattrtodbg.cc: Fixed  instances of << cerr when
       << endl was what was wanted.
     * ireptodbg.cc: Fixed cast from pointer to int as int
       is too small, causes build to error off.
     * irepdie.h,irepform.h: Rename form fields 
       from indirectform_ directform_
       to   initialform_ and finalform_ based on the realization
       that dwarf_whatform and dwarf_whatform were misnamed.
